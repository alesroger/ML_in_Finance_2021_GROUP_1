This repository presents the Jupyter notebooks used to produce investment recommendations. Machine Learning Data analysis delivers a buy/hold/sell strategy recommendation for shares in respect of the S&P500. 

<b>Buy:</b> A share outperformed the S&P500 by more than 2.5 percentage points for the year. \
<b>Hold:</b>  A share performed within +/- 2.5% percentage points of the S&P500 for the year. \
<b>Sell:</b>  A share performed below the S&P500 by more than 2.5 percentage points for the year.

The Main-file presents the structure of the data analysis starting with the preparation of the dataset and concluding with the ML algorithms. The best test-score is achieved with the XX-algorithm delivering a score of XXX.
